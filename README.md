[![Run on Repl.it](https://repl.it/badge/github/circutrider21/Manageo)](https://repl.it/github/circutrider21/Manageo)[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/circutrider21/Manageo.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/circutrider21/Manageo)

Manageo Is a Build system for windows that is designed to replace other build tools and make development a breeze.

## Status

Manageo is currently under development and currently only supports building on windows and only using golang.

We are currently experimenting with the syntax and also are working towards enableing custom workflows created with 

Json, Which will allow for faster deploy times and less errors.

## Usage

```bash

$ Manago go <filename>

```

## Collaborating and Final Words

Feel free to collaborate. Some features we need addded are...

1.  Json parsing
1.  Switch statement to handle os args
1.  And if you are handy with writing tests in golang, we need your help

In Conclusion More Features Will Be Added, So stay tuned and till then.
